**Note on Butterworth vs Walter:** Your document appropriately cites TWO different papers with similar titles:
- **Walter2023MSEWhen** (9 authors, DOI fsad031) - cited in Introduction
- **Butterworth2024When** (6 authors including Butterworth, Punt, Ianelli; DOI fsad040) - cited in Detailed Comparison section

These are legitimate distinct papers in the same journal issue.

## Additional Notes on Bibliography Quality

### Papers with Verified DOIs - 94% Coverage
- **Total entries in expanded bibliography:** 64 papers
- **Entries with DOIs:** 60/64 (94%)
- **Complete author lists:** 100%

### Recommendation for Going Forward

Given the identified hallucination issues:

1. **Use official sources** - Consider exporting your Zotero or Mendeley library directly to BibTeX format rather than relying on manually compiled or auto-generated lists
2. **Prioritize DOI verification** - All papers with DOIs should be verified against CrossRef (https://www.crossref.org/) or the journal's website
3. **For the broader bibliography** - If you plan to distribute the 64-paper bibliography to others, consider verifying additional entries beyond the 20 actively cited
