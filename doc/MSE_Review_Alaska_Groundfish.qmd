# Abstract

Management strategy evaluation (MSE) has become a central tool for testing fisheries policies under uncertainty, yet its uptake varies across regions and management systems. Alaska groundfish fisheries provide a compelling case for MSE because they combine long data series, sophisticated stock assessments, and formal harvest control rules embedded in two federal Fishery Management Plans. This review synthesizes how Alaska’s assessment and projection practices align with MSE concepts, distinguishes projection-based scenario analysis from full-feedback MSE, and outlines a practical pathway for implementation. We describe the core MSE components—operating, observation, assessment, and management procedure models—and show how existing Stock Synthesis–based infrastructure can support both scenario testing and full-feedback simulation. Building on Alaska’s history of scenario evaluation, we identify barriers (computational demands, institutional inertia, and expertise gaps) and enabling factors (data richness, established assessment models, and prior multispecies MSE work). We argue that an incremental, phased approach is most appropriate: systematizing scenario frameworks for near-term decision support while piloting full-feedback MSE for representative stocks to inform longer-term policy. The Alaska case illustrates how a mature assessment program can transition toward more formal, transparent strategy testing, with broader relevance for fisheries governance under climate change and structural uncertainty.

# Introduction

Management strategy evaluation (MSE) provides a structured way to test fisheries management procedures against uncertainty before they are implemented [@Punt2016; @Butterworth2007]. Foundational simulation studies, guidance on management procedure design, and practical early applications underpin modern MSE practice [@deLaMare1986; @Rademeyer2007Tips; @ButterworthCochraneDeOliveira1997]. Its growing use internationally reflects a shift from single-scenario projections toward explicit robustness testing of management rules. Alaska groundfish fisheries are well positioned for this shift because they are data rich, supported by mature assessment models, and managed under formal harvest control rules embedded in federal Fishery Management Plans (FMPs). At the same time, Alaska’s long history of projection-based scenario analysis offers a practical bridge between current practice and full-feedback MSE.

Recent historical synthesis of global stock assessment methods highlights how regional traditions diverged and later converged toward integrated statistical models, providing context for how Alaska’s assessment framework fits within broader methodological evolution [@CadrinGoethel2026]. This review has three objectives: (1) summarize the conceptual elements of MSE with emphasis on their relevance to Alaska groundfish; (2) contrast projection-based scenario analysis with full-feedback MSE and document how both are used in Alaska’s management system; and (3) propose a realistic, phased pathway for broader MSE adoption that aligns with existing institutional processes and data resources including features for climate resiliance.

To keep the discussion organized, the paper is structured as follows. The Alaska groundfish management context section provides just enough institutional and scientific background (FMPs, assessment cadence, and how advice is generated) to make the later MSE discussion interpretable; if it turns into a generic description of Alaska management, it will be doing low-value work and should be cut back. The MSE framework and components section is a short primer that defines the moving parts (OM, observation, assessment, MP, and performance metrics) and clarifies what “full-feedback” implies; its purpose is not to re-teach MSE, but to establish shared language for Alaska-specific arguments. The section on scenario projections and full-feedback MSE in Alaska is the core bridge: it distinguishes common projection/scenario practice from true management procedure testing, and makes explicit what is gained (and what remains missing) when moving to feedback simulations. The implementation pathway section then translates that conceptual distinction into a practical plan (fit to the existing FMP process, barriers/enablers, and an incremental rollout). Finally, implications for governance and climate adaptation links the technical choices to decision-making under climate-driven uncertainty, and the conclusions restate the few take-home claims that should survive peer review.
 
# Alaska groundfish management context

Alaska's groundfish fisheries are among the most valuable and scientifically sophisticated fisheries in the world. The North Pacific Fishery Management Council (NPFMC) manages these fisheries under two primary Fishery Management Plans (FMPs): the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands (BSAI) Groundfish FMP and the Gulf of Alaska (GOA) Groundfish FMP. These management regimes employ sophisticated stock assessment models, notably Stock Synthesis, to provide annual scientific advice on sustainable catch levels.

The current management approach relies on regular stock assessments and annual catch advice based on static harvest control rules. While this framework has been effective, there is growing recognition that more formal evaluation of management procedures—through Management Strategy Evaluation (MSE)—could enhance decision-making by explicitly testing the robustness of management strategies across different future scenarios and uncertainties [@Walter2023MSEWhen].

An early Alaska application illustrates this logic: A'mar et al. used MSE to evaluate the Gulf of Alaska walleye pollock management strategy under uncertainty in data and stock–recruitment dynamics, focusing on objectives to avoid low stock size while maintaining high, stable catches [@Amar2008GOAPollock].

# MSE framework and components

A complete MSE framework includes several interconnected components [@Punt2016; @PuntDonovan2007]:

Operating Model (OM). The operating model represents the "true" population dynamics, including stock growth, recruitment, selectivity, and other biological processes. In practice, an MSE includes multiple operating models, each representing a different set of assumptions about how the fish population actually behaves. This plurality of models captures structural uncertainty—the unknown aspects of stock biology.

Observation model. The observation model represents how imperfectly we observe the stock. It includes observation error in surveys, aging error in fishery samples, and uncertainty in effort estimates. This component captures the reality that managers make decisions with incomplete information.

Stock assessment model. Within each simulation cycle, a stock assessment is conducted using the simulated data. The assessment model (often Stock Synthesis) estimates current stock status based on the simulated observations, just as actual assessments do. The assessment model may differ from the true operating model, representing model misspecification risk.

Management procedure (MP). The management procedure is the decision rule that translates assessment results into management recommendations. For example: "Set catch equal to F_MSY times the current estimate of exploitable biomass." The procedure is deterministic—given an assessment result, it always produces the same recommendation. Importantly, in real fisheries the outcomes of an MP also depend on how fleets respond to regulations (e.g., effort reallocation, targeting shifts, and participation), so including behavioral feedbacks can be essential when evaluating MP robustness (see multispecies Alaska example in [@IanelliMultispecies2018]).

Performance metrics. These are the objectives we care about: sustainable yield, probability of rebuilding, variability in catch, risk of overfishing, etc. MSE quantifies how well different MPs achieve these objectives across operating models and scenarios, and can make explicit trade-offs when human behavior mediates how rules translate into realized fishing mortality [@IanelliMultispecies2018].

## Operating models and uncertainty

### Stock Synthesis as an Operating Model Platform

@Methot2013 describe Stock Synthesis (SS3), the primary assessment model used in Alaska groundfish fisheries. While SS3 was developed as an assessment platform, it can be configured as an operating model by setting specific parameter values and generating population dynamics without observation error. This dual use—assessment and OM configuration—makes it an efficient platform for MSE in data-rich fisheries.

Evolution of integrated assessment frameworks.

Over the last two decades, assessment software has moved toward integrated modeling frameworks that combine multiple data sources within a single likelihood, enabling consistent estimation across surveys, fisheries, and biological data. This evolution has supported more realistic simulation testing in MSE by making complex assessment and operating model configurations computationally feasible. Many of these advances trace to the ADMB/TMB lineage of automatic differentiation tools, which expanded access to flexible, high-dimensional estimation workflows. These developments paralleled calls for standardized computational frameworks for MSE and integrated assessment (e.g., @Schnute2007).

### Key uncertainties to represent

For Alaska groundfish, relevant sources of structural uncertainty include recruitment regime shifts, selectivity changes, stock structure, life‑history variation, survey catchability, and fleet behavioral responses to regulation [@Mueter2011; @Hollowed2019]. These sources should be represented in a suite of operating models that test management procedure robustness, including sensitivity to plausible behavioral responses (e.g., [@IanelliMultispecies2018]).

# Scenario projections and full-feedback MSE in Alaska

Full-feedback MSE explicitly links assessment, management decisions, and population dynamics across repeated simulation cycles. A related but distinct approach—projection-based scenario analysis—has long been used in Alaska to evaluate alternative assumptions and management actions. The two approaches are complementary: scenarios provide rapid, transparent decision support, while full-feedback MSE evaluates the robustness of decision rules over longer horizons [@Walter2023MSEWhen].

## Definitions and Alaska context

Simulation scenarios represent a more flexible, less prescriptive approach to
evaluating management outcomes under uncertainty [@DeMoor2011;
@Butterworth2007]. In practice, they project the population forward under
assumed conditions, vary key assumptions (e.g., recruitment, selectivity,
environmental states), test alternative management actions, and evaluate
outcomes against objectives. The key distinction from full MSE is that
scenarios often omit explicit decision rules tested repeatedly, full feedback
loops where assessment uncertainty drives decisions, formal stakeholder
engagement in defining objectives, and systematic robustness evaluation across
operating models. Their value is flexibility and computational efficiency for
exploratory analysis.

Alaska groundfish management has a strong history of using projection models
and simulation scenarios to evaluate management alternatives. These approaches
have provided decision makers with quantitative information about the
implications of different management choices.
In Alaska groundfish fisheries, simulation-based projections have routinely
evaluated alternative catch levels, allocation schemes, rebuilding strategies,
and bycatch mitigation options.
This approach has the advantage of being computationally tractable and
relatively easy to communicate to managers and stakeholders: "Here's what we
think will happen if we implement this policy."


Examples on the use of
simulation scenarios for groundfish management
(e.g., @Ianelli2011, @IanelliGOA2009; @IanelliEcosystem2009;
@IanelliMultispecies2018) typically start
from the current stock assessment. Then they specify alternative future conditions,
project forward with the assessment model, evaluate management decisions within
each scenario, and summarize outcomes as probability distributions. Their key
advantages are that they build directly on existing Stock Synthesis models,
remain transparent about assumptions, are relatively quick to implement, and
are easy to communicate. Limitations are that they do not explicitly propagate
assessment uncertainty into future decisions, may miss structural uncertainty,
are less suited to long‑term performance testing of fixed decision rules, and
omit feedback loops where current decisions influence future assessments.


The Alaska groundfish management framework is established through Fishery
Management Plans (FMPs) for both the Gulf of Alaska (GOA) and the Bering
Sea/Aleutian Islands (BSAI), which form the legal foundation for simulation
scenario analysis [@NMFS_2004_AlaskaGroundfishPSEIS]. The harvest strategy and
associated management procedures used in these FMPs were subjected to rigorous
scientific review [@Goodman2002HarvestStrategy], ensuring that simulation-based
scenario analysis is integrated into the decision-making framework. Within this
framework, projection scenarios are routinely used to evaluate catch
implications, rebuilding timeframes, alternative regulations, and trade‑offs
(e.g., foregone catch vs. bycatch reduction).
These analyses provide key inputs to the NPFMC decision-making process, even
though they may not constitute a formal "MSE" in the contemporary sense of that
term.


The methodological progression in Alaska groundfish management illustrates how
simulation approaches have evolved. The 2004 Groundfish SEIS
[@NMFS_2004_AlaskaGroundfishPSEIS] established the foundation for
projection-based scenario analysis within the current management framework.
This approach projects population dynamics forward under alternative
assumptions but does not include explicit feedback loops where assessment
uncertainty influences future management decisions.

A critical advancement is represented by Ono et al. [@IanelliMultispecies2018],
which develops a multispecies management strategy analysis framework that
incorporates full feedback simulation. In this framework, the operating model
generates population dynamics, simulated observations are produced with error,
assessments are conducted on those data, management decisions are made from
assessment outputs, and those decisions feed back into subsequent simulation
cycles where performance is evaluated.

This represents a transition from the projection-based scenarios of the 2004
SEIS era toward the full feedback MSE approach now being adopted
internationally. The Ono et al. framework demonstrates that Alaska groundfish
science has the capacity and expertise to implement more sophisticated MSE
approaches while building directly on existing assessment infrastructure.

## What each approach is for

The trajectory of fisheries management evolution follows a general pattern:
deterministic projections in the 1970s–1990s, probabilistic scenarios in the
1990s–2010s (with the 2004 Alaska Groundfish SEIS as a key foundation),
full‑feedback MSE in the 2010s–present (including the multispecies framework in
Ono et al. [@IanelliMultispecies2018]), and emerging adaptive,
ecosystem‑integrated approaches. Each phase builds on the previous, adding
sophistication and better capturing uncertainty and decision‑making realism.
Recent research [@Walter2023MSEWhen] shows that both approaches have complementary strengths.
Simulation scenarios (projection-based) use a linear structure:

```         
Assessment Model → Project Forward → Evaluate Outcomes
                    ↓
                Vary Assumptions
                    ↓
                Summarize Results
```

They are open‑ended and flexible (assumptions can change quickly),
computationally light, and easy to interpret and communicate. Typical uses are
exploratory analysis, immediate management decisions, assumption testing, and
rapid response to new information. Examples include questions such as: under a
recruitment regime shift, what catch is sustainable; if trawl selectivity
increases by X%, what bycatch reduction follows; or what allocation maximizes
yield across sectors.

Full-feedback MSE uses a circular feedback structure:

```         
Operating Model → Management Procedure → Feedback
     ↓                    ↓
Assessment  ← Decision Rule ← Feedback to Assessment
     ↓
Evaluate Management Procedure Performance
```

It is prescriptive and formal (testing specific MPs under repeated feedback
cycles), more computationally intensive, and designed for long‑term strategy
evaluation and robustness testing. Typical uses include assessing performance
across multiple operating‑model assumptions, formal strategy comparisons, and
stakeholder‑focused trade‑off analysis. Examples include questions such as: how
does a harvest control rule perform across 100 recruitment scenarios; what is
the probability of staying above a limit reference point under a 20%
productivity change; or which strategy best balances conservation and economic
objectives.

An important point: simulation scenarios and full MSE are not necessarily
competing approaches. Rather, they represent different points on a spectrum of
analytical sophistication, each with appropriate uses:

Simulation scenarios are appropriate for immediate decisions, operational
management (evaluating specific catch recommendations), exploratory analysis,
communication with non‑technical audiences, and rapid assessment when
conditions change.

Full‑feedback MSE is appropriate for strategic decisions, policy development,
robustness testing across scenarios, formal evaluation processes with
stakeholders, and institutional change.

For Alaska groundfish management, both simulation scenarios and full MSE have
roles:

For Alaska groundfish management, simulation scenarios provide operational
flexibility, rapid decision support built on existing Stock Synthesis
infrastructure, and communication‑friendly outputs that can adapt quickly to
new information.

Full‑feedback MSE provides a strategic, long‑term perspective with explicit
robustness testing, formal trade‑off analysis, and a rigorous basis for
updating FMP management procedures.

# Implementation pathway for Alaska groundfish MSE

## Fit within current FMP structure

The BSAI and GOA Groundfish FMPs already embody many MSE principles
[@Free2023HCR], including explicit operating objectives, formal harvest control
rules (Amendment 56 and the GOA FMP), annual assessment procedures, and routine
consideration of uncertainty via scenario evaluation.

A formal MSE in Alaska groundfish would systematically test current harvest
control rules against multiple sources of uncertainty, compare alternatives in
a structured framework, engage stakeholders in defining objectives and
trade‑offs, document assumptions, and identify vulnerabilities and potential
improvements.

## Barriers and enabling factors

Key barriers include computational demands, data/modeling requirements for
multiple operating models, institutional inertia, stakeholder uncertainty about
process implications, and expertise gaps in formal MSE implementation.

Enabling factors include existing Stock Synthesis infrastructure, strong data
foundations with long time series and multiple surveys, substantial scientific
expertise, demonstrated value from other regions (e.g., SPRFMO and tuna RFMOs),
and council interest in more formal evaluation procedures.

## Practical recommendation: phased implementation

Rather than attempting a complete MSE transition immediately, a phased approach
leveraging both simulation scenarios and full MSE would be optimal:

### Phase 1: Enhanced Simulation Scenarios (Years 1-2)

Objectives focus on expanding projection capabilities, building a systematic scenario framework, and improving communication. Actions include systematizing climate-change scenarios, developing recruitment‑regime scenarios, creating decision‑support tools, and improving visualization and documentation. Expected outcomes are stronger operational decision support, better stakeholder understanding of uncertainty, and a foundation for transition to full MSE.

### Phase 2: Pilot Full MSE (Years 2-4)

Objectives are to develop an MSE framework for representative stocks, formally test current HCRs, and compare MSE results with scenario‑based analysis. Actions include selecting pilot stocks (e.g., Bering Sea and GOA pollock), developing operating models for key uncertainties, formalizing management procedures as decision rules, and running MSE trials. Outcomes are a demonstrated MSE framework, clearer understanding of how MSE alters advice, and institutional learning.

### Phase 3: Integrated Approach (Years 4+)

Objectives are to integrate scenario analysis and full MSE into routine decision‑making, expand to ecosystem considerations, and develop climate‑adaptive strategies. Actions include annual scenario analyses for operational decisions, full MSE reviews every 5–10 years for strategic policy, integration of ecosystem indicators, and explicit climate‑adaptation strategies. Outcomes are formalized MSE‑informed management, enhanced robustness, and improved stakeholder engagement and transparency.

# Implications for fisheries management and climate adaptation

The Alaska case illustrates how a data-rich, assessment-driven management system can transition toward formal MSE without discarding existing practices. This has implications beyond the region: scenario-based projection analyses can provide immediate decision support, while full-feedback MSE offers a transparent framework for evaluating harvest control rules and management procedures against realistic climate-driven uncertainty (via conditioned operating model specifications) [@Hollowed2019; @EcosystemBased2020Nature]. Rather than treating MSE as an abstract governance improvement, the Alaska case is best understood as improving the decision mechanism: the explicit rule that maps assessment outputs (and their uncertainty) into ABC/OFL advice, the review process that evaluates that mapping, and the feedback loops by which realized outcomes update future advice. The value of MSE is that it forces consideration of trade-ffs—yield, risk, and stability—to be stated in operational terms and evaluated under alternative assumptions, including climate-driven changes in productivity and availability [@Punt2016].

For Alaska groundfish specifically, climate change and shifting productivity regimes heighten the value of structured scenario frameworks and adaptive policy testing [@Hollowed2019; @Thorson2019Spatial]. A near-term research priority is to expand operating models to include plausible recruitment and distributional shifts, while a longer-term priority is to integrate ecosystem indicators and multispecies interactions into management procedures [@IanelliMultispecies2018]. These priorities align with broader calls for ecosystem-based fisheries management and climate-ready harvest strategies.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Conclusions

Management Strategy Evaluation offers a systematic framework for evaluating the robustness of fisheries management procedures. For Alaska groundfish, the sophisticated state of stock assessments, the richness of available data, and the expressed interest in more formal evaluation procedures create an opportune moment to develop MSE capacity.

A phased implementation that leverages both scenario analysis (for operational decisions) and full-feedback MSE (for strategic policy) would provide the most value [@Barbeaux2020; @Free2023HCR]. This approach recognizes that projection scenarios, as exemplified by work of Ianelli and colleagues [@Ianelli2011; @IanelliMultispecies2018], have an important role in operational management and rapid decision support, while formal MSE provides complementary value for longer-term policy development and robustness assurance [@Punt2016; @EcosystemBased2020Nature].

Positioned as a review for Fish and Fisheries, the Alaska groundfish experience demonstrates how mature assessment programs can progressively adopt MSE to strengthen transparency, robustness, and climate readiness. The central message is not replacement but integration: building on existing scenario tools while expanding toward full-feedback MSE offers a pragmatic route to improved decision-making under uncertainty.
