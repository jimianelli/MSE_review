## Why This Paper is Important

This paper directly addresses a critical question in your MSE review: **when MSE is and is not appropriate**. Rather than assuming MSE is always the right tool, Walter et al. (2023) provide guidance on:

- **When MSE adds value** - situations where formal evaluation of management procedures is warranted
- **When MSE may not be needed** - cases where simpler approaches suffice
- **Resource considerations** - practical aspects of conducting MSE

This complements your discussion of simulation scenarios vs. full-feedback MSE by addressing the broader strategic question of management procedure evaluation.

## Where It Appears in Your Document

**Location:** Introduction section, paragraph on recognition of MSE value

**Context:** The citation appears in the discussion of how Alaska's current management approach relies on annual assessments and static harvest control rules, with growing recognition that formal MSE evaluation could enhance decision-making.

**Full Sentence:**
> The current management approach relies on regular stock assessments and annual catch advice based on static harvest control rules. While this framework has been effective, there is growing recognition that more formal evaluation of management procedures—through Management Strategy Evaluation (MSE)—could enhance decision-making by explicitly testing the robustness of management strategies across different future scenarios and uncertainties [@Walter2023MSEWhen].
