TEMPORAL TRENDS IN MSE LITERATURE
================================================================================

Phase 1 - Foundation (1989-2010): 5 papers
  Establishment of theoretical framework and initial development of
  management strategy evaluation concepts.

Phase 2 - Expansion (2013-2019): 11 papers
  Rapid expansion of MSE applications including special issue in CJFAS.
  Introduction of ecosystem and stakeholder considerations.

Phase 3 - Current Era (2020-2025): 13 papers
  Focus on climate change, data-limited approaches, ecosystem integration,
  and international harmonization of MSE guidelines.

Key Observation: 2019 represents a major inflection point with 8 papers
(27% of total collection), largely due to the CJFAS special issue on
"Recent Advances in MSE" and increased RFMO adoption of MSE frameworks.


MAJOR RESEARCH THEMES
================================================================================

1. MANAGEMENT PROCEDURE DEVELOPMENT AND EVALUATION
   - 17 papers address development, testing, and robustness of
     management procedures
   - Key focus: How to evaluate procedures under uncertainty

2. STAKEHOLDER PARTICIPATION AND COMMUNICATION
   - 4 papers specifically address stakeholder engagement, communication,
     and feedback mechanisms in MSE processes
   - Trend: Increasing recognition of need for stakeholder involvement

3. OPERATING MODELS AND STRUCTURAL UNCERTAINTY
   - 8 papers discuss conditioning and application of operating models
   - Key focus: Representing uncertainty and structural sensitivity

4. HARVEST CONTROL RULES
   - 5 papers focus specifically on HCR design and evaluation
   - Species: Jack mackerel, sockeye salmon, Pacific cod, bigeye tuna

5. ECOSYSTEM AND CLIMATE CONSIDERATIONS
   - 5 papers address ecosystem-based approaches and climate impacts
   - Emerging theme: Multi-species and climate-adaptive management

6. DATA-LIMITED AND DECISION-MAKING FRAMEWORKS
   - 3 papers address MSE for data-limited situations
   - Practical challenge: Time-constrained decision processes


GEOGRAPHIC AND SPECIES COVERAGE
================================================================================

Regional Focus:
  - North Pacific (NPFC, ICES)
  - South Pacific (SPRFMO)
  - Indian Ocean (IOTC)
  - Atlantic (IATTC)
  - Broader North American contexts (NOAA, Canadian)

Species Covered:
  - Jack mackerel (Trachurus murphyi) - most developed MSE program
  - Sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka)
  - Bigeye tuna (Thunnus obesus)

This indicates that MSE has become a key methodology across diverse
fisheries management jurisdictions and for multiple species types.

NOTES ON SEARCH RESULTS
================================================================================

Search Completeness:
  - 29 papers identified through comprehensive search
  - Most papers found in /Downloads with full paths documented
  - /reprints folder contains general methods/references but no dedicated
    MSE section

Limitations:
  - Some workshop presentations excluded if primarily slides without
    accompanying papers
  - Code and script files identified but not included in bibliography
  - Some papers may be in archives or temporary folders

Recommendations:
  - Consider creating dedicated MSE folder with organized structure
  - /mnt/reprints could benefit from 30_MSE_MANAGEMENT_STRATEGY folder
  - Regular updates needed as new MSE research continues (2-3 papers/year
    expected based on recent trends)
