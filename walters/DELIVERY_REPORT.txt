PROJECT SUMMARY
================================================================================

WHAT YOU HAVE:
  A complete, production-ready implementation of the Walters (2004) closed-loop
  MSE methodology that can be used immediately for research, publications, and
  collaboration on Alaska groundfish management strategy evaluation.

WHAT YOU CAN DO:
  • Test different harvest control rules
