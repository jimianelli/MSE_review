Description: Implements a closed-loop Management Strategy Evaluation (MSE)
    framework based on Walters (2004), including an operating model using a
    delay-difference population dynamics equations, lognormal observation
    error, Kalman filter stock assessment, harvest control rules, and
    performance metrics. Supports comparison of management procedures under
    structural uncertainty relevant to Alaska groundfish fisheries.
