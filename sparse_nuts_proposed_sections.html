    <h2>Abstract</h2>
    <p>
      Sparse NUTS (SNUTS) preconditions posteriors using a sparse precision matrix Q
      computed with Template Model Builder (TMB) at the Laplace marginal mode, then
      samples the preconditioned posterior with Stan's NUTS. Across seventeen case
      studies, preconditioning with Q converges one to two orders of magnitude faster
      than Stan's diagonal or dense preconditioners and outperforms using
      Pathfinder-based covariance. SNUTS scales beyond 10^4 parameters when posteriors
      are approximately Gaussian with sparse, correlated structure, but it does not
      help funnel, heavy-tail, or multimodal geometries. An open-source implementation
      is provided in the R package SparseNUTS.

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      NUTS is widely used for Bayesian hierarchical models, but large correlations and
      scale differences can make warmup long and sampling inefficient. Default workflows
      adapt a diagonal mass matrix during warmup and therefore do not address correlations,
      which limits practical model size.
    </p>
    <p>
      Template Model Builder (TMB) provides sparse precision matrices for a broad class of
      hierarchical models via Laplace-based marginal optimization. We leverage this to build
      Sparse NUTS (SNUTS), which preconditions a posterior using Q before NUTS sampling.
      We implement SNUTS in an R package and evaluate it on simulated models and seventeen
      case studies, including embedded Laplace variants.

    <p>
      We describe the NUTS preconditioning problem, introduce sparse decorrelation using Q,
      and outline the SNUTS workflow and evaluation design.
